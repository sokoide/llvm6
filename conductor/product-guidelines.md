# Product Guidelines

## Language & Documentation
*   **Code & Comments**: All source code, internal documentation, and inline comments MUST be written in **English** to maintain compatibility with standard development practices and tools.
*   **Commit Messages**: Commit messages MUST be written in **English** and follow a professional, concise format.

## Communication Tone
*   **Professional & Concise**: Technical descriptions should be factual and brief. Avoid unnecessary fluff or overly emotional language. Focus on the "what" and "why" of technical decisions.

## User Interface & Error Reporting
*   **Clang/GCC Style**: Error messages MUST provide detailed feedback, including source file location (line and column) and a clear description of the issue, similar to industry-standard compilers like Clang or GCC.
*   **Clarity**: Maintain consistent terminology throughout all CLI outputs to ensure predictability for the user.
